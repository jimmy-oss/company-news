5. Postgresql

## Setup/Installation
1. Install Postgres SQL to be able to create a local database on your machine.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Clone the repository to your machine.
4. Open the folder in your IDE of choice.
5. Run the command `postgres` in a terminal.
6. Create two `sql` files named `create.sql` and `drop.sql`. The `create.sql` file should contain
 the following commands
        ``` CREATE DATABASE company_news;
            \c company_news;
            
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR,
            position VARCHAR,
            role VARCHAR,
            department VARCHAR
            );
            
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS news (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            title VARCHAR,
            content VARCHAR,
            type VARCHAR,
            author VARCHAR
            );
            
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS departments (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR,
            description VARCHAR,
            totalemployees INTEGER
            );
            
            
            CREATE DATABASE company_news_test WITH TEMPLATE company_news;```
            
 The `drop.sql` file should have the following commands
         ```DROP DATABASE company_news_test;
            DROP DATABASE company_news; ``` 
 
 7.Run the command `psql < create.sql` in a separate terminal window.
 
 8.Go to the IDE and navigate to the folder with the main file App.java, then compile and run the
  program on the
  terminal. Alternatively, run the program in your IDE.
 9.In the terminal, locate the url address showing the spark server port number. For example
 , this can be http://localhost:4567/user
 You can then change the routes to access different pages.
